# winfastnav
A fast navigation bar for Windows.

--

The purpose of this project is to make a navigation bar similar to PowerToys run, in Go, for the purpose of learning Go.

This is my first Go program, with assistance from the golang's official docs, and a little bit of o4 to ease some teething pains of learning a new enviroment.
